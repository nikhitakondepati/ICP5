question: Which algorithm do you get better accuracy? Can you justify why? 
answer: The Linear SVM algorithm achieved a higher accuracy of approximately 0.68, which is better than the accuracy of approximately 0.31 obtained with Naïve Bayes. Therefore, the Linear SVM algorithm has the best accuracy in this comparison. "The Linear SVM model outperforms Naïve Bayes with higher accuracy and better balance across performance metrics. Naïve Bayes assumes feature independence, which may not hold here. The Linear SVM's ability to handle complex relationships makes it a better choice for this task, achieving higher accuracy and balanced performance across classes in the 'glass' dataset."
